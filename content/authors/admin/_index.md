I am a PhD student majoring in computer vision at SNU computer vision lab, advised by prof. Kyoung Mu Lee.
I am interested in various topics in computer vision and machine learning, including low-level vision problems (video frame interpolation, image/video super-resolution), attention models in neural networks, meta-learning, etc.
